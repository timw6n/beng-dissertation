# Including mutation testing as part of a continuous integration workflow

This repository mainly contains the Markdown source files for my BEng Computer Science project at the University of York.

The submitted project report can be found as [submission/project.pdf](https://github.com/timw6n/beng-dissertation/blob/master/submission/project.pdf) within this repository and, for York users, in the departmental project library.

The code produced as part of this project can be found in the following two repositories:
* **MultiMutiny** — [timw6n/multimutiny](https://github.com/timw6n/multimutiny)
* **MultiMutiny Cloud Reports** — [timw6n/mm-cloud-reports](https://github.com/timw6n/mm-cloud-reports)

An instance of the latter application is live at [https://multimutiny-cloud-reports.appspot.com](https://multimutiny-cloud-reports.appspot.com).
